# Embranglements demo

A demonstration of Infusion to implement multilateral proximity-based embranglement (entanglement, co-occurrence).

The proximity of a triple of agents identified by selectors is signalised into a space of "embranglement signals"
which is then transduced into the existence of corresponding embranglement instances bound to the matched reagents.
